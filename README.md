My name is Udoka Ineh and I am a product designer.
I became really curious as to how my designs are being brought to live hence my new found interest in front-end development.
I started learning HTML and CSS on my own through free resources online and watching youtube tutorials.
Then through ingressive for good I got a scholarship to study front-end development from Stutern and I am so grateful about this opportunity.
Learning from Stutern has made this journey easy for me because now I get to learn through a structured and well defined process.
So far, I am doing great and I am intrigued by how different command line, codes and code editors works, the dynamism and mechanism.
At the end of this training, I want to be a really good front-end developer added to my design knowledge to be among the world best.
